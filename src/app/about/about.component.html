					When you want to change a Champion, their ability level allocations, your rune selection, and many other important factors in League of Legends, you'll need to open the Practice Tool for every separate configuration. That's a lot of
					configurations!
					<br><br>
					League Theory Crafter is a quick and easy way to look at a Champion's approximated damage output based on the many different factors in League of Legends without the long switch times when using the Practice Tool. It provides other
					meaningful calculations, such as the damage distribution, which is important to assess how to deal the most with your unique builds.

					Don't fret! Calculations are not meant to be exact values of what's in-game. There are thousands of combinations of interactions that a champion can undergo, so calculations are an approximation of what a champion can do given the
					circumstances.
					<br><br>
					If there are large discrepencies in the way damage is calculated, fixes will be dealt with as soon as they are noticed. Contact me so we can get it fixed!

					To provide an easy-to use interface, there has to be trade-offs in the way sections are designed. When you increase flexibility, complexity increases and intuitiveness tends to decrease.
					<br><br>
					Flexibility and customizability is something that can always be improved on and I'm open to suggestions from you guys to make this a better product for the League of Legends community! Send me your suggestions by contacting me and we can
					work on making those a great addition to the platform.

		<div class="component-body about">
			Hi there! My name is Anthony, and I'm currently a Computer Science student in Ontario. I've been playing League of Legends for over 8 years and a hard-stuck plat Jungle main that abuses Rek'Sai and never plays AP junglers. I've always wanted an
			easy-to-use application that can tell me if this build is viable
			or better than existing ones.
			<br><br>
			I never found anything that was intuitive, simple, and straight forward. So I started learning a new framework, Angular, and built this application straight from the ground up, consisting of the UI/UX, writing, design structure, data
			collection, and all of the other engineering that makes League Theory Crafter work.
			<br><br>
			I spent a lot of time altering the structure and fine-tuning details that makes it intuitive, simple, and straight forward without compromising functionality.
