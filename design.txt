select champions, level, items (including certain specialized items) -> select targets that have items and levels => dummy target on the champion component
remove items from your inventory -> base function done
expected damage/healing output on target? -> not dps
buffs and debuffs -> grevious wounds, drakes, potions (apply one), champion abilities, runes (gathering storm, eyeball collection, ghost poro, hunters, )
how do you account for toggle abilities?
tldr champion abilities
use disclaimer
popular builds (user sign up process to submit builds) -> load builds (filtered by patch, most popular)
2 web scrapers -> 1 for patch notes on upcoming changes, one for current patch (toggle for damages on proposed changes and its differences) -> runs weekly (patches can come more often or not) -> what about hotfixes?

runes component
champion component (can includes stats?)
inventory component (total additive stats?)

mouseover tldr abilities, passives, items, runes

2 column layout?
left -> selected champion, items, runes
right -> target champion, items, runes
next row -> computational stats -> expected dps

what is the design?
